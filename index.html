          To provide practical education of the subjects that will be needed
          in the jobs of the future and not taught in the traditional
          education system.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">What is <span class="commune-small orange">Commune?</span></h2>
        <p class="whitepaper-text">
          Commune is a non-traditional education platform that provides
          practical education about subjects that are needed in an advancing
          world and are not taught in traditional education in a fun and
          engaging manner.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Who is our <span class="orange">Target audience?</span></h2>
        <p class="whitepaper-text">
          The teens and young adults of India between the age 12 and 25 who are
          mostly students.

          What is the need of <span class="orange">Commune?</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="whitepaper-text">
          The current education system in India was introduced in the 19th
          century. Even with the hardly changing education system the demand for
          jobs has witnessed many changes owing to the invention of the
          Internet, blockchain, artificial intelligence to name a few.
          Therefore, we believe that the education system should evolve as well
          and it must not be confined within the four walls of a classroom where
          students memorize the information and must enjoy learning in a
          practical way.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">What makes us <span class="orange">different:</span></h2>
        <p class="whitepaper-text larger-text">
          A) There are few courses and videos and internet that are created by
          individuals or institutions available on the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="whitepaper-text">
          But there are a few issues: <br><br>
          <span class="orange large-text">1) Quality of content: <br> </span>
          There are videos or
          articles available on certain skills in social media platforms like
          YouTube. But there is no assurance of the quality We will be Getting
          only people who have a strong knowledge and experience of the
          respective subject which will be verified.
          <br> <br>
          <span class="orange large-text">2) Lack of features and Interactiveness: <br> </span>
          Most of the videos and courses on the internet are
          one -way communication and lack some important learning tools which
          are vital for learning for our target audience. We will provide
          several learning and interactive features such as live classes, doubt
          clearing helpline, tests, and certificates as well as rewards after
          the completion of certain courses. <br><br>

          <span class="larger-text">B) The team behind <span class="commune orange larger-text">commune</span>: <br><br>
          </span>

          The team behind commune belongs to the same age group as the target
          audience and hence can understand what the target audience wants. <br><br>

        <hr>
        <p class="whitepaper-text">
          <span class="larger-text">C) The way of presentation: <br><br></span>
          Most of the courses found online are focused
          towards specific skills and are mainly focused towards people looking
          to add a skill to their resume. Instead of courses, it will be
          presented in the way of different subjects and will be presented as a
          necessity.
